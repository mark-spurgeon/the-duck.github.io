<h1>How to keep social distances in Geneva's streets ?</h1>
<p> Geneva is one of the most <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2018/mar/22/most-densely-populated-square-kilometres-europe-mapped" target="_blank">densely populated cities in Europe</a>. For that reason among others, it has seen <a href="https://www.corona-data.ch" target="_blank">many cases</a> of COVID-19 infections.
</p>
<p> As of April 18th 2020, the situation in Switzerland is encouraging, prompting the government to slowly relax social distancing measures.
</p>
<p> However, with a growing number of cases and no vaccine to this day, we need to keep avoiding physical contact. It is crucial that during our trips outside, to shop, run or have a quick walk, we must keep a safe distance of <b>2 metres</b> from each other.
</p>
<p> However, citizen struggle to respect that distance, especially when they have to <b>queue outside</b> to shop for food.
</p>
<p> This map estimates the areas where <b>free space is missing</b> compared to the demand from the shops. It also points at <b>pedestrianization measures</b> that the local government should consider. In the next weeks, as more shops will open doors, these measures will be necessary to keep everybody safe. </p>
