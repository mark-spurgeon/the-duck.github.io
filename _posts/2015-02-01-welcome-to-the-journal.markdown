**Welcome !**       
With a new release of Duck Launcher, packed with a new design and a new Plugin Store, comes a new website. Well it's just a little modified from the old one. So I decided to  add this little blog, this _journal_ (nice word eh?) to announce releases, future plans and general thoughts. Duck Launcher might be extended into a complete desktop environment(mainly for the fun of doing it:)) and such a project needs to have somewhere to post announcements ( and not google+ posts).
