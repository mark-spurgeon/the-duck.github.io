<h3> What is the Duck Launcher ?</h3>
<p>The Duck Launcher is an application launcher made primilarily for linux. 
It doesn't have many other features than launching applications, as the app is still in beta, 
but its advantage is that it is written in python, meaning that it is incredibly easy and quick to add 
and remove stuff.</p>
